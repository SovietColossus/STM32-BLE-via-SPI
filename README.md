# P442 Trail Counter Bluetooth

Project made by Ian Brown, Jordan Gaeta and Gleb Alexeev
Please see P442FinalWriteUp.PDF for details
-----------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to measure footsteps on trails in a low energy manner through vibrations via an accelerometer. The hardware used includes an STM32 ARM processor board with an onboard accelerometer. Likewise, we used the Adafruit Bluefruit LE SPI Friend for bluetooth communication, and a custom made Iphone App for getting the data and offloading the data onto a private server.
